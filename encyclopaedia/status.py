        Create the persistent status variables to manage the "New!" status if
        the Encyclopaedia is save game independent.

        If the Encyclopaedia is tied to a save game state, using persistent
        variables is unnecessary.

        This will create the variables, but it's up to you to use them in
        the "status" argument for an EncEntry.

        This function must always be called when the game starts.

        If you want a save game specific "New!" status,
        don't use persistent variables,
        and create the EncEntry after the start label, not in an init block.

        How it works:
        Two dictionaries are created:
        persistent.<name>_cache
        persistent.<name>_dict.

        master_key is the prefix for all the keys in both dictionaries.
        name is the prefix for the dictionary names.
        Both default to "new".

        When this function runs, each key in persistent.new_cache is
        given the value of an entry in persistent.new_status and vice versa.
        eg: persistent.new_cache["new_00"] = persistent.new_status["new_00"]
            persistent.new_status["new_00"] = persistent.new_status["new_00"]

        Each EncEntry must use persistent.new_status["new_<x>"]
        for their status variable.
        <x> being an integer.

        Why it works:
        If the value is None or False, "New!" is displayed.
        As each entry is opened and exited, the value in new_status
        is set to True.

        Each time the game is started, new_cache is set to
        whatever the matching new_status value is.
        new_status then sets itself to whatever new_cache is.

        The reason this is all necessary is that if an Encyclopaedia
        is created in an init block, there's no way to save the data without
        using persistent data, but you don't want the init to reset
        the persistent data each time the game opens and the Encyclopaedia is
        created anew.
