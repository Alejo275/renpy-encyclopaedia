Manual Numbering
================

By default, entries are numbered in the order they're added to the Encyclopaedia.

However, if you need an entry to have a specific number, you can specify this when creating the entry.

WARNING: This will only work if the number you want to use has not already been automatically assigned.
ie: If you have six entries, then for the seventh try to assign it to 4, this will fail.

        parent=encyclopaedia,

        text = [
            "When creating an entry, the 'number' argument can be used to specify what number the entry will have."
            " If it's not provided then the entry will be automatically assigned the next available number.",
            "Numbered entries must be defined before non-numbered entries."
