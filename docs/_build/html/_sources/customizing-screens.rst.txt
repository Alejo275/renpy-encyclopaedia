Customizing Screens
===================

The following screens are provided in the framework and are found inside encyclopaedia_screens.rpy:

encyclopaedia_list: Displays all the buttons used to visit entries in a vertical list, along with sorting and filtering options. It takes one argument: The Encyclopaedia you want to display.

encyclopaedia_entry: Displays one single entry. It takes one argument: The Encyclopaedia you want to fetch entries from.

Both these screens can be skinned by modifying their styles or using Ren'Py Screen Language.

They can also be used as guides for creating completely customized screens.
The screens an Encyclopaedia uses can be changed, making the use of the default screens completely optional.
