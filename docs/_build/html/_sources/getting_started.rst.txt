Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

Download the files from the /dist directory and place them into your project's 'game' directory.

Creating an Encyclopaedia
-------------------------

Inside an init python block, create a new Encyclopaedia.
This is the top-level container for all your entries.

.. code-block:: python

    init python:
        your_new_encyclopaedia = Encyclopaedia()

Adding Entries
--------------

Once you have an Encyclopaedia, EncEntry objects need to be created.
These are where the information for each Entry goes.
The minimum arguments to create an EncEntry are:

- parent: The container for the entry. Can be an Encyclopaedia or another EncEntry (for sub-pages)

- name: The name for the entry. Doesn't need to be unique.

- text: The text for the entry. Can be a string or list of strings.

.. code-block:: python

    entry_one = EncEntry(
        parent=your_new_encyclopaedia,
        name="Zeus",
        text=[
            "Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus."
            " His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter."
            " His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin."
        ]
    )

Locking and Unlocking Entries
=============================

By default, all EncEntry objects are unlocked. They can be viewed by players at any time.
However, when creating an EncEntry, the locked argument can be given with a variable as a flag, effectively hiding the entry until the condition is true.",
The entry will be locked until an the unlock_entry() function is called on the entry to unlock it.

.. code-block:: python

    entry_one = EncEntry(
        parent=your_new_encyclopaedia,
        name="Zeus",
        text=[
            "Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus."
            " His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter."
            " His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin."
        ],
        locked=True
    )
